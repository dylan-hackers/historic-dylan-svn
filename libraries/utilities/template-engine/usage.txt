   Overview
==============

A template document is a text stream containing directives and normal text. To
use a template document, a program first creates a '<template>' object and reads
the document, then calls 'process-template' on that object to generate an output
string. The '<template>' object can be created once and processed multiple
times.

Directives can access variables and operations specified by the program. These
variables and operations form the vocabulary available for use in template
document expressions. The program can specify a base vocabulary when it creates
the '<template>' object and can specify additional or replacement vocabulary
when it calls 'process-template'.

Programatically, vocabulary words are strings that map to bindings. In the case
of operations, these bindings must be single-argument functions. The template
processor looks up the value of the binding when it processes the template
document's expressions. The template processor can treat these words as
case-sensitive or case-insensitive; this is configured when the program creates
the '<template>' object. The library provides a 'template-vocabulary' macro to
easily add vocabulary words.

The program can specify which directives are recognized in the template document
when it creates the '<template>' object. Briefly, the directives are:

Template	- Changes the delimiters used to set off other directives.
Case		- Selects which of several alternative sections to process.
If		- Selects whether to process a section.
Repeat		- Processes a section for each element of a collection.
With		- Creates local variables or operations.
Substitution	- Evaluates an expression and outputs it.
Escape		- May be used to include delimiters in the output.
Empty		- May be used for finer whitespace trim control.

Expressions are comprised of literals, operators, and vocabulary words. They are
much like Dylan expressions, but more limited. There is no support for function
calls aside from the function application (".") operator.

Literals are strings, characters, decimal integers, hexadecimal integers, #t, or
#f. Adjacent strings are combined and Dylan escape sequences are recognized.

Operators are logical ("~", "&" and "|"), arithmetic ("+", "-", "*", "/", "%"),
relational ("=", "~=", "<", ">", "<=", ">="), grouping ("(" and ")"), or
function application ("."). These operators work like their Dylan counterparts
and with the same operator precedence; the modulo ("%") operator is also
recognized and acts at the same precedence level as division. The operand of
function application may be a literal.

Vocabulary words follow the syntax of Dylan names, except for possible
case-sensitivity as mentioned above.


================
   Directives
================

Directives may be delimited by one of these pairs: (( )), [[ ]], {{ }}, or << >>.
The default is {{ }}, but this may be changed programatically when the
'<template>' object is created or in the template document itself using the
"template" directive.

Directives may include comments delimited by the pair (* *), for example:

| {{ hours / 60 / 60 (* to show seconds *) }}

Whitespace preceding and following each directive may be removed during parsing
by including a "+" just inside the opening or closing delimiter. This includes
newline characters. For example, template A below results in output B and not C.

Template A:
| Greetings, {{ name +}} !

Output B:
| Greetings, Felix!

Output C: 
| Greetings, Felix !

You can use an empty directive for better control of whitespace removal. While
template D results in erroneous output E, you can use template F to produce
correct output G.

Template D:
| Greetings, {{ title +}}
| {{ name }}!

Output E:
| Greetings, SirRobin!

Template F:
| Greetings, {{ title +}} {{ +}}
| {{ name }}!

Output G:
| Greetings, Sir Robin!

Whitespace removal happens at parsing time, when the '<template>' object is
created, not at processing time. This means that whitespace is removed from
around a directive -- and only around that directive -- regardless of whether
that directive is actually processed or not.

Consider template H below, and output I generated for an age of 10 and output J
generated for an age of 30. Output I is correct, but output J is incorrect
because the "+" in the "end" directive only applies to the whitespace between
the "first-name" and the "end" directives, not to the whitespace after the
"last-name" directive.

Template H:
| {{ if age > 15 +}} {{ title }} {{ last-name }}
| {{ else +}} {{ first-name }}
| {{+ end }}, hello!

Output I:
| David, hello!

Output J:
| Mr. Johnson
| , hello!


------------------------
   Template Directive
------------------------

This directive takes the following forms:

| {{ template }}
| [[ template ]]
| (( template ))
| << template >>

It simply changes the delimiter style. If present, this directive must appear
first in the template document -- only whitespace may precede it -- and can only
appear once.

The program may disable this directive when creating the '<template>' object.


--------------------
   Case Directive
--------------------

This directive takes the following form:

| {{ case TEST-1 }} CONTENT-1
| {{ case TEST-2 }} CONTENT-2
| ...
| {{ else }} ELSE-CONTENT
| {{ end }}

It will process and output the first alternative where the 'TEST' expression
returns a true value (that is, some value other than #f). If none do, it
processes and outputs 'ELSE-CONTENT'. The "else" directive and its content are
optional.

The program may disable this directive when creating the '<template>' object.


------------------
   If Directive
------------------

This directive takes the following forms:

| {{ if TEST }} CONTENT
| {{ else }} ELSE-CONTENT
| {{ end }}

| {{ when TEST }} CONTENT
| {{ else }} ELSE-CONTENT
| {{ end }}

| {{ unless TEST }} CONTENT
| {{ else }} ELSE-CONTENT
| {{ end }}

It will process and output 'CONTENT' if 'TEST' returns a true value (or a false
value in the case of "unless"). Otherwise it will process and output
'ELSE-CONTENT' if provided. The "else" directive and its content are optional.

The program may disable this directive when creating the '<template>' object.


----------------------
   Repeat Directive
----------------------

This directive takes the following forms:

| {{ repeat with ELEMENT-NAME in COLLECTION }} CONTENT
| {{ end }}

| {{ repeat with ELEMENT-NAME in COLLECTION info in INFO-NAME }} CONTENT
| {{ end }}

It will process and output 'CONTENT' for each element in the collection returned
by the 'COLLECTION' expression. If the collection is empty, it ignores
'CONTENT'.

During the processing of 'CONTENT', the current element and information about
the current iteration will be available through the 'ELEMENT-NAME' and
'INFO-NAME' variables. Any pre-existing variables with those names will not be
available until outside the "repeat" directive block.

The 'INFO-NAME' variable, if provided, is associated with an internal object.
The template engine provides four Dylan accessor functions on this object. By
default and if the "repeat" directive is enabled, the base vocabulary of the
'<template>' object includes these functions under their own names. However, if
the program overrides the base vocabulary, it may have to explicitly specify
these functions' vocabulary words.

The 'INFO-NAME' functions are:

first-rep?	- Returns #t if this iteration is for the first element in the
                  collection.
last-rep?	- Returns #t if this iteration is for the last element in the
 		  collection.
rep-number	- The iteration number, starting from 1.
rep-key		- The collection key of this element; for a sequence, this will
		  be the iteration number except starting from 0.

The program may disable this directive when creating the '<template>' object.


--------------------
   With Directive
--------------------

This directive takes the following form:

| {{ with VAR-NAME = EXPRESSION, 
|         operation OP-NAME = EXPRESSION,
|         ... }} CONTENT
| {{ end }}

It will create one or more local variables or operations available within the
"with" directive block. Any pre-existing variables or operations with those
names will not be available until outside the "repeat" directive block. Variable
and operation assignments may be mixed freely in the comma-separated list.

The program may disable this directive when creating the '<template>' object.


----------------------------
   Substitution Directive
----------------------------

This directive takes the following forms:

| {{ EXPRESSION }}

| {{ EXPRESSION !}}

The first form sanitizes and outputs the result of the expression. The second
form outputs the result of the expression without sanitization.

All directives allow the "!" unsanitized marker, but it only has an effect with
this directive. The unsanitized marker comes just before a "+" whitespace
removal marker:

| {{ EXPRESSION !+}}

The result of the expression is converted into string form using a function that
takes one argument and returns a string, and is sanitized by another function
that takes a string and returns a different string. The program may customize
both functions when it creates the '<template>' object. By default, the string
conversion function uses 'format-to-string' and the sanitizer is 'identity'.


----------------------
   Escape Directive
----------------------

This directive is not really a directive at all, but takes the following form:

| {{{ CONTENT }}}

This is output as the following, with CONTENT being processed and output as
normal (in particular, CONTENT can contain other directives):

| { CONTENT }

This directive works with all the delimiter styles as you'd expect:

| ((( CONTENT ))) => ( CONTENT )
| [[[ CONTENT ]]] => [ CONTENT ]
| <<< CONTENT >>> => < CONTENT >


---------------------
   Empty Directive
---------------------

This directive takes the following form:

| {{ }}

It may contain comments and the "!" and "+" markers, but does not output
anything.
